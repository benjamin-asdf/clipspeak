Just make sub clips from a video at a Clojure repl.

I was manually putting those timestamps into ffmpeg commands.
Then I looked for simple cutting software. But 'simple cuttting software' is not simple.

* Mpv

#+begin_src shell
  mpv --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvsocket foo.mp4
#+end_src

you start mpv like so and

=mpv/curr-timestamp!= has the meaning of the current hh:mm:ss timestamp.
I assume you know how to eval and insert with your editor, build a snip dsl, say =doit= and be happy.

May the force be with you my friend.
